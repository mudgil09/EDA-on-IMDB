# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on IMDB Dataset

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a critical process for performing initial investigations on data to discover patterns, spot anomalies, test hypotheses, and check assumptions using summary statistics and graphical representations. In this project, we will perform EDA on the IMDB dataset to gain insights into popular films and series ratings.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains information about the most famous 6,000+ films and series on IMDB, including their ratings. This data is perfect for EDA, and you can find it on Kaggle. IMDB is a well-known platform for rating films and series, making this dataset a valuable resource for analysis.

## Objectives

In this EDA, we aim to answer some interesting questions about the IMDB dataset, such as:

- What are the top-rated films and series on IMDB?
- How are the ratings distributed across the dataset?
- Are there any correlations between film attributes (e.g., runtime, genre) and ratings?
- What are the trends in IMDB ratings over time?

## Tools and Libraries

To perform this EDA, we will utilize the following tools and libraries:

- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/): A powerful data manipulation library for data storage and processing.
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/): A fundamental library for numerical computations.
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/): A versatile library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/): A data visualization library based on Matplotlib that provides a high-level interface for creating informative and attractive statistical graphics.

## Code Structure

The EDA code will be structured into the following sections:

1. Data Loading: Loading the IMDB dataset.
2. Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
3. Data Exploration: Analyzing the dataset to answer our questions.
4. Data Visualization: Creating visual representations of the data using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
5. Data Insights: Drawing conclusions and providing insights from the analysis.

Stay tuned for the detailed EDA process and visualizations in the upcoming sections.

## Getting Started

To get started with this EDA project, you can follow these steps:

1. Download the IMDB dataset from Kaggle.
2. Install the required libraries using `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn`.
3. Run the EDA code to explore the dataset and answer the questions.

Let's dive into the fascinating world of IMDB data and discover some intriguing insights!

Happy Exploratory Data Analysis!
